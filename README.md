## ðŸš€ Running the Playbook

To execute a playbook:

```bash
ansible- inventory inventory/hosts playbook.yml -K
```
- Replace playbook.yml with the playbook file name inside the respective directory.

- -K or --ask-become-pass prompts for the sudo password, which is required when the playbook contains tasks that need elevated (root) privileges, like installing packages or modifying system files.
